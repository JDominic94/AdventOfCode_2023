# AdventOfCode_2023

Here are all my solutions and the inputs for [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install nessesery packages. It try not to use any or only native packages, but will add some if the complexity, speed or my laziness makes it necessary.
As such [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) would be an allrounder around matrix operations.

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

Usually I structure my code as such:

```python
import packages

# Clean function for Part 1
def Part_1():
    # Explainable code
    return easy_solution

# Clean function for Part 2
def Part_2():
    # Explainable code
    return easy_solution

# Here I try to compress a whole solution into one beast line of code for each part
print("Day X, Part 1", complex_line)
print("Day X, Part 2", complex_line)
```

## Contributing

Comments are very welcome, as I try to improve constantly. Otherwise I only participate for fun and some puzzle solving to keep the brain smooth.
